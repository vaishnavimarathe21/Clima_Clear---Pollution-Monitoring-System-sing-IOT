## 🔍 About the Project

**Clima Clear** is a smart IoT-based pollution monitoring system designed to measure and visualize real-time air quality data using various gas sensors connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller**.

It detects gases such as **CO₂**, **CO**, **LPG**, and other harmful pollutants, and transmits the data over **Wi-Fi** for live tracking and analysis through a web-based interface.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. ESP32 reads sensor values for gases, temperature, and humidity  
2. Sensor data is processed and sent via Wi-Fi  
3. Frontend displays results with graphs and real-time analysis  
4. User can monitor pollution levels and changes easily

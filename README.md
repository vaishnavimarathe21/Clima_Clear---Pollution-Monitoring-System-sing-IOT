## 🔍 About the Project

**Clima Clear** is a smart IoT-based pollution monitoring system designed to measure and visualize real-time air quality data using various gas sensors connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller**.

It detects gases such as **CO₂**, **CO**, **LPG**, and other harmful pollutants, and transmits the data over **Wi-Fi** for live tracking and analysis on a digital interface.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. ESP32 reads real-time data from gas sensors
2. Data is processed in Arduino IDE and printed to serial monitor or cloud dashboard
3. Wi-Fi module (inside ESP32) transmits data wirelessly
4. Optionally, cloud dashboards like Blynk/Thingspeak show air quality graphs and alerts

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Connect ESP32 with gas sensors via breadboard
2. Program ESP32 using Arduino IDE
3. Upload code and open Serial Monitor for real-time data
4. (Optional) Connect to cloud platforms for remote access

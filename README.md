## 🔍 About the Project

**Clima Clear** is a smart IoT-based pollution monitoring system designed to measure and visualize real-time air quality data using various gas sensors connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller**.

It detects gases such as **CO₂**, **CO**, **LPG**, and other harmful pollutants, and transmits the data over **Wi-Fi** for live tracking and analysis through a web-based interface.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📡 Real-time monitoring of air quality data
- 🧪 Detects multiple gases using sensors like MQ-135, MQ-2, MQ-7, etc.
- 🔌 Powered by ESP32 Wi-Fi microcontroller
- 🌐 Web interface for data visualization with charts and pollution analysis
- ☁️ Ready for integration with platforms like Blynk or Thingspeak

## 🚀 How It Works

1. ESP32 reads sensor values for gases, temperature, and humidity.
2. Sensor data is processed and sent via Wi-Fi.
3. Frontend displays results with graphs and real-time analysis.
4. User can monitor pollution levels and changes easily.

## 📋 Demo & UI Flow

- **Home Page** welcomes users with intro and navigation  
- **Result & Analysis** page shows live pollution levels (CO, NO₂, SO₂, PM2.5, etc.)  
- **Graphical visualization** helps interpret real-time air data effectively
